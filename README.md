ReactCodePen
============

Good news, everyone! CodePen now supports Babel and JSX natively!

~~Include this file before the JSXTransformer in your external libraries in your JS Panel on Codepen.
Standard JSX Transformer rules apply (include your /** @jsx React.DOM */ comment at the top of the JS file).~~

~~I'm currently looking to prevent the 'Unexpected token <' when the JS first attempts to run so pull requests are welcome :)~~

~~For an example, check out [this CodePen](http://codepen.io/mfunkie/pen/BnzKx)~~
