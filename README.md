ReactCodePen
============

Include this file before the JSXTransformer in your external libraries in your JS Panel on Codepen.
Standard JSX Transformer rules apply (include your /** @jsx React.DOM */ comment at the top of the JS file).

I'm currently looking to prevent the 'Unexpected token <' when the JS first attempts to run so pull requests are welcome :)
